# Specification Quality Checklist: Run the web service as an LXC container

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The deliverable is itself a deployment artifact, so a few platform facts appear in the requirements (Debian 13, Node 24, ed25519, port 3000, `/var/lib/bellhop`). Each is a constraint the operator stated or a default the installer exposes, not an internal design choice, so they stay.
- The installer cannot be live-tested in this change (it creates real infrastructure); see Assumptions.
